# Project 4 - *Twitter*

**Twitter** is a basic twitter app to read and compose tweets the [Twitter API](https://apps.twitter.com/).

Time spent: **13** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] User can sign in using OAuth login flow
- [x] User can view last 20 tweets from their home timeline
- [x] The current signed in user will be persisted across restarts
- [x] In the home timeline, user can view tweet with the user profile picture, username, tweet text, and timestamp.
- [x] Retweeting and favoriting should increment the retweet and favorite count.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] User can load more tweets once they reach the bottom of the feed using infinite loading similar to the actual Twitter client.
- [x] User should be able to unretweet and unfavorite and should decrement the retweet and favorite count.
- [x] User can pull to refresh.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
- Use custom presentation for presenting view controller to improve user experiece (slide in and out)
- Log out implmented
- Animate icons changes after retweet and favor
Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. Add tab bar, notification, profile scene, etc
2. Load media and add attributed string for hash tag, link, etc
